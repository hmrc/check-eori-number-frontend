Check EORI Number Frontend
===================

This microservice provides a frontend web interface to the [Check Eori Number](https://github.com/hmrc/check-eori-number) microservice to provide users with a way to:

* check if an EORI number beginning with GB (issued by the UK) is valid.
* view the name and address of the business that the EORI number is registered to (if the business agreed to share this information).

This service is written in [Scala] and [Play], so needs at least a [JRE] to run.

    Note: Make sure that service-manager-config is up to date locally

 2. Start the services:
 
        Run the services against the current versions in dev, stop the CHEN_FRONTEND service and  start manually
        
            sm2 --start CHEN_ALL 
            sm2 --stop CHEN_FRONTEND
            cd check-eori-number-frontend
